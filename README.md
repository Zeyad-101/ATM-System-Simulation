# 💳 ATM System Simulation

## 📌 Overview

This project is a console-based ATM simulation developed using C++ in Visual Studio.
It mimics real-world ATM functionality by allowing users to perform secure banking
operations through a simple interface.

## 🚀 Features

- User authentication using PIN verification
- Balance inquiry
- Cash withdrawal with validation
- Deposit functionality
- Basic transaction handling
- File-based data storage
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- C++
- Visual Studio
- OOP Concepts (Classes, Functions, File Handling)

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open `ATM System.vcxproj` or the solution file in Visual Studio.
2. Build the project (`Ctrl + Shift + B`).
3. Run the application (`Ctrl + F5`).
4. Use the console interface to simulate ATM operations.
